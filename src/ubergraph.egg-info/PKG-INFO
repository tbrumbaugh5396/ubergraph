# Ubergraph

This is a package used to wrap [pygraphviz](https://pypi.org/project/pygraphviz/) to create ubergraphs.

Ubergraphs are based upon [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.05547.pdf).

# Importing ubergraph

from ubergraph import ubergraph

# Functions

## Create an ubergraph

You can create an ubergraph which is simply a directed graph in pygraphviz.

u = ubergraph.ubergraph()

## Add a node to the ubergraph

You can add nodes to your ubergraph.

u = ubergraph.add_node(u, "node")

## Add an edge to the ubergraph

You can add edges to your ubergraph.
The lists may be empty.
Any undefined nodes or edges will be added to the ubergraph.

u = ubergraph.add_edge(u, "edge", list_of_from_nodes, list_of_to_nodes, list_of_from_edges, list_of_to_edges)

## Get the nodes in the ubergraph

You can get the nodes in your ubergraph.

nodes = ubergraph.get_nodes(u)

## Get the edges in the ubergraph

You can get the edges in your ubergraph.

edges = ubergraph.get_edges(u)

## Get the nodes and edges from a node or edge

u = get_from(u, node_or_edge)

## Get the nodes and edges to a node or edge

u = get_to(u, node_or_edge)

## Get the edges that a node or edge is in

u = get_in_edges(u, node_or_edge)

## Get the edges that is in a node or edge

u = get_out_edges(u, node_or_edge)
